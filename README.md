# Raytracing
This program is based on the book ''Raytracing in on weekend' by Peter Shirley. But unlike the original, it is completely rewritten in C (standart C11).

# How to Start
You need:
  - Install C - compiler (I use Clion)
  - Install Python (> 3.10)
  - Install Pillow (library for Python)
      Pip install Pillow
The most important thing is that the file converter.py, run.bat and Raytracing.exe are in the same directory.
Double click on the run.bat or launch in comand line (I use Far Manager)
